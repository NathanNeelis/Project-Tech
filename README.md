## Description
Friendship is a dating service, not meant for romantic relationships but for friendships. Do you feel alone sometimes and would you like to get in touch with people that have the same ineterests as you? Then Friendship is here to help! With friendship you’ll create a profile with your interests, for example, going to the gym, playing board games, or videogames, or gardening. After you have created your profile, you’ll be able to search other profiles for specific interests. Let’s say you would like to play a board game, in the filter function you will let our database know to filter out people that are also interested in board games. When you find some suitable matches based on age, location, you can get in contact with other “board gamers” and see if they’re up for a game.


## Job story
**When** I'm bored at home, at the beginning of the evening, watching cooking shows on Netflix, while I'm already done with all my homework  
**I want to** get in touch with people that have the same interests as me  
**So I** can ask them if they want to do something fun that is in both our interests.
